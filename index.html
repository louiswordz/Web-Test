    <h1>Introduction to HTML</h1>
    <p>This lesson is an introductory step-by-step walkthrough of creating a 
        simple HTML page. After completing this lesson, you will dive deeper into 
        all of these objectives and start using them more independently in 
        the subsequent lessons.

        To get the most out of this lesson, make sure you follow each 
        step and type out each line of code on your own. While it may 
        be tempting to copy and paste code into your text editor, this 
        approach will slow down your learning in the long run. Typing out
         the code helps you to develop muscle memory,
         which will help you to memorize important syntax more quickly.</p>
